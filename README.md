The demise of google podcasts had me revisit all my audio and video 'feeds'.

The wonderful [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/releases/2.14.1/docs/newsboat.html) application will do nearly all the heavy lifting a person or group could want. 

It's CLI only at the moment... so I can't recommended to the unitiated... BUT, while getting my own feeds sorted, I could find myself building the basis of a group newsfeed agregator that I can share with non-techy people.

Monitoring my ~700 subscriptions has become quite different since I went the newsboat route.. 99% of it way better (for me) than the phone app/websit/algo world - and none of this stops me from signing into youtube now and then, and giving the algo
a little 'snack' and learning about some new stuff.

I'm hoping to be fun-employed in the latter half of 2024 and work on this 'full time'.

Wow!! the idea of using great opensource software, writing some myself and giving people access to what remains a miraculaos internet (for those that don't get swallowed by algos)
