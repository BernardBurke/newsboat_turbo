The demise of google podcasts had me revisit all my audio and video 'feeds'.

The wonderful [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/releases/2.14.1/docs/newsboat.html) application will do nearly all the heavy lifting a person or group could want. 

It's CLI only at the moment... so I can't recommended to the unitiated... BUT, while getting my own feeds sorted, I could find myself building the basis of a group newsfeed agregator that I can share with non-techy people.

Monitoring my ~700 subscriptions has become quite different since I went the newsboat route.. 99% of it way better (for me) than the phone app/websit/algo world - and none of this stops me from signing into youtube now and then, and giving the algo
a little 'snack' and learning about some new stuff.

I'm hoping to be fun-employed in the latter half of 2024 and work on this 'full time'.

Wow!! the idea of using great opensource software, writing some myself and giving people access to what remains a miraculaos internet (for those that don't get swallowed by algos)

# Languages

My own content management is a combo of tools, services and 'glue', which I've largely written in bash and python.

The long term goal here is to write a python project that will force me to learn the newer trends (eg: pydantic and friends)

## FOSS shout outs

As well as the [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/releases/2.14.1/docs/newsboat.html) folks, I'd like to thank:

- The [Linux Kernel](https://kernel.org) folks, without whom the FOSS world would be tiny instead of expansive
- The folks at [Nix](https://nixos.org/), who I believe are leading the way for package and resource management
- [The Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) community, who provide a super highy quality distro that helps me rescue people
from Windows and OSX.
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) - you guys totally rock.
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/), the only media player you'll ever need.
- I'm now using co-pilot and gemini to help me with code... Not feeling shame here, I'm just being an adaptive Boomer (my daugther 
calls me a Bloomer)
